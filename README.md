# Readme for Multivariate Statistics Final Project

In this project, I analyzed a Kaggle Ames Housing Prices dataset. 

I used three multivariate techniques in this analysis:

**1. MANOVA:** how are a home’s sale price and total surface area affected by the features of the home? Do certain combinations of features relate to differences in the mean sale price and/or the mean surface area?

	* Interaction plots
	* Evaluating MANOVA using different statistics
	* Univariate contrasts
	* Generalized linear models
	* Chi-squared plots 

**2. Factor Analysis:** are there certain combinations of features of a home that indicate a “latent variable” or underlying unifying factor? 

	* Relationships across variables, calculating KMO, determining suitability for factor analysis
	* Determining latent factors
	* Performing factor analysis and determining extraction method
	* Using a varimax rotation

**3. Discriminant Analysis:** do homes that sell for “low”, “medium”, or “high” prices have fundamentally different features, 
or are they similar in some respects but different in others?

  * Stepwise discriminant analysis
	* Determining discriminating ability of each function
	* Plotting and interpreting discriminant analysis function scores
